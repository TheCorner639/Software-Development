I am Connor Monson, I go to Cedar High School, and this class is the Software Development class in Southwest Tech.
This repository exists for Exercise 3-2 in the Software Development class. The files in this repository are significant because I need them to get points on my assignments.
I was born in College Station, Texas though I grew up in Cedar  City, Utah. I have one brother and two sisters. I like coding, fossils, gaming, and haning out with freinds.
I am taking Software Development because it will help me get a job in the future, and because I like coding.
